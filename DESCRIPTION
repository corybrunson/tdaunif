Description: This package contains functions that generate uniform random
    samples from simple manifolds, optionally with noise, which are commonly
    used to test topological data analytic (TDA) tools. The samplers make use of
    two techniques: analytic volume-preserving parameterizations, as employed by
    Arvo (1995) <doi:10.1145/218380.218500>, and rejection sampling, as employed
    by Diaconis, Holmes, and Shahshahani (2013) <doi:10.1214/12-IMSCOLL1006>.
